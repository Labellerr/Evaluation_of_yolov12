# Evaluation_of_yolov12

## Overview
This project involves experimenting with the YOLOv12 model and comparing its performance with a previous model. The evaluation includes testing the models on video data and identifying the shortcomings of the previous model.

## Experimentation with YOLOv12
We conducted a series of experiments using the YOLOv12 model. The experiments were designed to evaluate the model's performance in various scenarios and compare it with the previous model.

## Advantages of YOLOv12
The YOLOv12 model demonstrated several improvements over the previous model:
1. **Higher Accuracy**: YOLOv12 achieved higher accuracy in object detection, even in challenging conditions.
2. **Faster Processing**: YOLOv12 processed video frames faster, enabling real-time detection.
3. **Improved Robustness**: YOLOv12 handled varying lighting conditions and occlusions better, resulting in more reliable detections.

## Conclusion
The YOLOv12 model outperformed the previous model in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These improvements make YOLOv12 a better choice for real-time object detection in video data.
